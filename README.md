# OI_Explore_Potential_Therapeutic_Targets

## Overview
This project focuses on exploring potential therapeutic targets for Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI), also known as brittle bone disease. OI is a genetic disorder characterized by fragile bones that are prone to fractures. The goal of this project is to identify genes or pathways affected by mutations associated with OI that could be targeted for the development of new treatments.

## Key Steps
1. **Mutation Identification:** Identify known mutations in genes associated with OI using databases such as HGMD or ClinVar.
2. **Gene and Pathway Analysis:** Analyze the genes affected by these mutations and the pathways they are involved in.
3. **Functional Analysis:** Conduct functional analysis to understand the role of these genes and pathways in OI pathogenesis.
4. **Drug Target Prediction:** Predict potential drug targets within the identified genes or pathways using computational tools.
5. **Validation Studies:** Validate potential therapeutic targets using experimental techniques.
6. **Therapeutic Development:** Explore the development of new treatments targeting the identified genes or pathways.

## Motivation
OI is a rare genetic disease with limited treatment options. By identifying potential therapeutic targets, this project aims to contribute to the development of new and more effective treatments for OI patients.
